### Responsiveness

### Styling

### Recipes
- Upload multiple photos
- Select "hero" photo 
- Batch file upload

### Profile
- User info section
- User photo upload

### Nav/Search
- Sorting
- Pagination
- Selectable search fields in fuzzy search

### Error Handling

### Misc
- Fix clickable area for delete recipe/comment confirmation (currently must click directly on text; no handler on containing element)
- Add filter to comments section to allow users to see their "already rated" comment
